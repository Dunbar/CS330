to be resolved:
-could use of of both upper and lower case of same letter cause issues?

-current flag symbol does not differentiate between different sections of the flag. 

-tree-type platforms in second level (based off 1-3) have been replaced with blocks. Acceptable?

-flying koopas in second level have been removed. Acceptable?

-moving platofrms replaced with stationary ones. Acceptable?
will need to sort out how we are choosing to represent the flag.
